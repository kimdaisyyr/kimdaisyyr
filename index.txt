About me

I am student at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill pursing at Master's in Linguistics.

I interested in studying linguistics through a multidisciplinary lens, primarily focusing on semantics, pragmatics, and sociolinguistics. I have a background in computer science and remain interested in computational linguistics.
Generally, I am passionate about social justice and the influence of language and technology in activism and advocacy.

Language Learning
I have always been interested in learning new languages. I have taken classes in Spanish, Yucatec Maya, German, and American Sign Language. I recently returned from a study abroad trip to Valladolid, Mexico, where I focused on practicing my Spanish while learning Yucatec Maya.

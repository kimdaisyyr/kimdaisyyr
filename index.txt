About me

I am student at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill pursing at Master's in Linguistics.

I interested in studying linguistics through a multidisciplinary lens, primarily focusing on semantics, pragmatics, and sociolinguistics. I have a background in computer science and remain interested in computational linguistics.
Generally, I am passionate about social justice and the influence of language and technology in activism and advocacy.
